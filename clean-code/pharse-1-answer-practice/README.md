# Clean Code Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating clean code principles and refactoring techniques.

## Files Overview

### `BadCodeExamples.java`
Contains examples of common code smells and anti-patterns:
- Long methods with multiple responsibilities
- Poor naming conventions
- Long parameter lists
- Commented-out legacy code
- Feature envy

### `CleanCodeExamples.java`
Contains refactored versions showing clean code practices:
- Single responsibility methods
- Meaningful naming
- Small, focused functions
- Proper separation of concerns
- Self-documenting code

### `CalculationRequest.java`
A clean data transfer object demonstrating:
- Immutable design
- Clear naming
- Single responsibility

### `Operation.java`
A simple enum showing clean enumeration design.

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Study the Bad Examples**: Understand what makes code hard to read and maintain
2. **Compare with Clean Examples**: See how the same functionality can be written cleanly
3. **Practice Refactoring**: Try refactoring the bad examples yourself
4. **Apply to Your Code**: Use these patterns in your own projects

## Key Learning Points

- **Naming**: Variables and methods should reveal intent
- **Size**: Functions should be small and do one thing
- **Comments**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Formatting**: Consistent style improves readability
- **Structure**: Classes should have single responsibilities
