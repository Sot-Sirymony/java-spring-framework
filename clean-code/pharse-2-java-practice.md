Here are **100 hands-on tasks** to practice **Clean Code in Java ‚Äì Phase 2: Functions, Classes & Objects (Week 3‚Äì4)**. These are grouped by topic and aligned with *Clean Code* Chapters 6‚Äì10, with emphasis on writing maintainable and testable code.

7. Rename mixed-purpose methods to better reflect their primary role.
8. Convert imperative logic to smaller declarative helper methods.
9. Review a method with multiple return types and simplify.

12. Break a function that reads and writes data into two separate methods.
13. Use functional decomposition to reduce large method size.
14. Avoid side effects in a method and log them separately.
15. Convert a method with inline conditions to a clearly named function.
16. Identify functions that hide behavior (e.g., ‚Äúget‚Äù methods that change state).
17. Apply the "One Level of Abstraction per Function" rule to a method.
18. Refactor a function that takes too many responsibilities.
19. Replace a nested loop with helper methods.
20. Inline intermediate variables when they're redundant.
21. Rename a function to better express its *intention*, not *implementation*.
22. Replace multiple `if` blocks with polymorphic function calls.
23. Write a unit test for a function that clearly separates input/output.
24. Compare two versions of a method: one clean, one messy.
25. Measure cyclomatic complexity before and after refactoring.

## üß© 2. Clean Classes (SRP, Cohesion) ‚Äì *25 tasks*

26. Review a class with too many responsibilities and identify logical separations.
27. Refactor a God Object into multiple smaller classes.
28. Split a class that handles both I/O and business logic.
29. Break a utility class into meaningful domain-specific classes.
30. Apply SRP by moving unrelated methods to new classes.
31. Design a `UserService` class with strict SRP.
32. Implement a cohesive class that only deals with one concept (e.g., `InvoicePrinter`).
33. Remove unrelated methods from a model class (e.g., `User` doing too much).
34. Group related fields and methods together in a class.
35. Design a `Logger` class that delegates actual logging to strategy implementations.
36. Implement a small domain model with 3 tightly cohesive classes.
37. Rename a class that violates its original intent.
38. Analyze cohesion in a legacy class and suggest improvements.
39. Create a service class that delegates responsibilities to helper classes.
40. Eliminate static methods that act on object data‚Äîmove them inside objects.
41. Avoid using DTOs for logic‚Äîconvert DTOs to domain objects before processing.
42. Move helper methods from client classes to appropriate domain classes.
43. Write a class diagram before refactoring a messy object structure.
44. Encapsulate field access in a class‚Äîreplace public fields with private and getters.
45. Create a cohesive class using only final fields and constructor injection.
46. Use Object Calisthenics rule: one level of indentation per class.
47. Refactor a builder class to improve method chaining and readability.
48. Convert procedural code with multiple functions to a well-structured object.
49. Refactor switch-heavy classes into polymorphic subclasses.
50. Test for class cohesion using LCOM metric (if tools are available).

## üßØ 3. Error Handling (Clean Try-Catch, Avoid Null) ‚Äì *20 tasks*

51. Replace a method that returns null with `Optional<T>`.
52. Refactor `try-catch` blocks into a centralized error handler.
53. Avoid catching `Exception`‚Äîcatch specific exceptions only.
54. Write a method that throws meaningful custom exceptions.
55. Create an exception hierarchy for a domain (e.g., `PaymentException`, `ValidationException`).
56. Remove nested `try-catch` blocks by extracting functions.
57. Avoid logging and throwing in the same place‚Äîdelegate one responsibility.
58. Wrap a third-party API call in a safe try-catch block with clear error messages.
59. Use `try-with-resources` for resource cleanup (e.g., file, DB).
60. Convert error-prone return codes to exceptions.
61. Use `Optional` chaining and `orElseThrow()` for cleaner null handling.
62. Refactor legacy null-checking code to use `Objects.requireNonNull`.
63. Extract error-handling logic from main business logic.
64. Document thrown exceptions using JavaDoc.
65. Validate arguments in constructors with meaningful error messages.
66. Create a fail-fast validation layer for inputs.
67. Remove catch blocks that do nothing or swallow exceptions silently.
68. Replace `null` map values with `Optional` or default objects.
69. Use custom exceptions for rule violations instead of boolean return values.
70. Refactor a class to support both checked and unchecked exception strategies.

75. Replace repeated constant values with named constants.
76. Create a base class or interface to eliminate redundant logic.
77. Refactor test cases with duplicate setup logic using `@BeforeEach`.

79. Avoid copy-pasting across classes‚Äîuse composition or inheritance.
80. DRY up service layer methods using generic patterns.
81. Group similar configuration keys and values in one place.
