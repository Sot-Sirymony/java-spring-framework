## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing Phase 2, you will be able to:

1. **Write clean functions** that do one thing and follow command-query separation
2. **Design cohesive classes** with single responsibility principle
3. **Handle errors gracefully** using proper exception handling
4. **Apply DRY principles** to eliminate code duplication
5. **Avoid side effects** and write pure, testable functions

## 📚 How to Use These Examples

1. **Study the bad examples** to understand common anti-patterns
2. **Compare with clean examples** to see refactoring techniques
3. **Read the detailed answers** for each task category
4. **Practice with the sample projects** to apply concepts
5. **Use as reference** during your own refactoring work

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Start with `answers/clean-functions.md` for function design principles
2. Move to `answers/clean-classes.md` for class design
3. Study `answers/error-handling.md` for robust error handling
4. Learn `answers/dry-vs-wet.md` for code reuse
5. Master `answers/avoiding-side-effects.md` for pure functions

Each answer file contains:
- Detailed explanations of concepts
- Before/after code examples
- Best practices and guidelines
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Practical exercises

## 📝 Progress Tracking

Use the task numbers (1-100) to track your progress:
- ✅ Tasks 1-25: Clean Functions
- ✅ Tasks 26-50: Clean Classes  
- ✅ Tasks 51-70: Error Handling
- ✅ Tasks 71-85: DRY vs WET
- ✅ Tasks 86-100: Avoiding Side Effects

## 🎓 Certification

After completing all 100 tasks, you should be able to:
- Refactor complex methods into clean, single-purpose functions
- Design classes with high cohesion and low coupling
- Implement robust error handling strategies
- Eliminate code duplication effectively
- Write pure, testable functions without side effects

Remember: Clean code is a journey, not a destination. Practice these principles daily in your real projects!
