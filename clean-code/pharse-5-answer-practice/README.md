## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing Phase 5, you will master:

1. **TDD Mastery**: Write tests first, then implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
2. **Test Types**: Understand unit vs integration testing strategies
3. **Clean Test Structure**: Apply AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern
4. **Mocking & Stubbing**: Use Mockito effectively for isolated testing
5. **Test Readability**: Write clear, maintainable test code

## 📋 Progress Tracking

- [x] Section 1: TDD (Test-Driven Development) (25 tasks)
- [x] Section 2: Unit vs Integration Testing (20 tasks)
- [x] Section 3: Clean Test Structure (15 tasks)
- [x] Section 4: Mocking and Stubbing (25 tasks)
- [x] Section 5: Test Naming & Readability (15 tasks)

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks You'll Practice With

- **Testing Framework**: JUnit 5
- **Mocking Framework**: Mockito
- **TDD Tools**: IDE support for test-first development
- **Build Tools**: Maven/Gradle test configuration
- **Spring Testing**: @SpringBootTest, @MockBean
- **Test Containers**: For integration testing

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

- **TDD Cycle**: Red (failing test) → Green (passing test) → Refactor
- **Test Isolation**: Unit tests should be fast and independent
- **AAA Pattern**: Arrange (setup) → Act (execute) → Assert (verify)
- **Mocking Strategies**: When and how to use mocks effectively
- **Test Naming**: Descriptive names that explain behavior

## 🧪 Testing Best Practices

- Write tests that are **fast**, **independent**, **repeatable**, **self-validating**, and **timely** (FIRST)
- Use **Given/When/Then** or **AAA** structure for clarity
- Mock external dependencies, not internal collaborators
- Write tests that focus on **behavior**, not implementation
- Keep tests **simple** and **readable**

## 🎯 Section Summaries

### Section 3: Clean Test Structure (AAA)
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Helper methods and utilities
- Test data organization
- Clear assertions
- Avoiding implementation details

### Section 4: Mocking and Stubbing

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing Phase 5, you should:

1. **Practice TDD** on real projects
2. **Apply AAA pattern** consistently
3. **Use Mockito** for dependency isolation
4. **Write descriptive test names**
5. **Review and refactor** existing tests
6. **Share knowledge** with your team
