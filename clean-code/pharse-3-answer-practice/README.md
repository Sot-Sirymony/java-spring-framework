## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master the **SOLID principles** for extensible, maintainable code
- Apply **YAGNI** and **KISS** to avoid overengineering
- Practice **TDD** for robust, testable code
- Implement core **design patterns** (Strategy, Factory, Singleton, DI)
- Build and refactor real Java code using these principles

## 📚 How to Use These Answers

1. **Read the answer files** in the `answers/` directory for each topic
2. **Study before/after code** and explanations for each task
3. **Practice with the example code** in the `examples/` directory
4. **Apply the patterns** in your own projects
5. **Use the checklists** for self-review before code reviews or commits

## 📝 Progress Tracking

- ✅ Tasks 1–50: SOLID Principles
- ✅ Tasks 51–70: Clean Design Mindsets (YAGNI, KISS, TDD)
- ✅ Tasks 71–90: Design Patterns
- ✅ Tasks 91–100: Final Review & Application

## 🚀 Quick Start

- Start with `answers/solid.md` for SOLID
- Move to `answers/clean-design-mindsets.md` for YAGNI, KISS, TDD
- Study `answers/design-patterns.md` for core patterns
- Use `answers/final-review.md` for review and project application

Remember: Clean, extensible code is a journey. Practice these principles in every project!
