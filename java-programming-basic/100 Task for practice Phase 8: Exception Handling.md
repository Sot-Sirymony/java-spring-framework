15. Handle exceptions inside a loop gracefully.
16. Handle array access in loop with wrong index range.
17. Handle string operations that cause `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
18. Nest `try-catch` blocks and print which one catches the exception.
19. Use `finally` to release a resource (e.g., closing a scanner).
20. Try accessing an element from an empty list using `get()`.
21. Catch `ClassCastException` when casting improperly.
22. Handle `IllegalArgumentException` in method input.
23. Catch exceptions thrown by `Integer.parseInt()` with invalid string.
24. Create a simple calculator with exception handling.
25. Write a method that always executes `finally` regardless of exception.

5. Use `throws` in method declaration for `InterruptedException`.
6. Call `Thread.sleep()` and handle the exception using `throws`.
7. Demonstrate that unchecked exceptions don't need `throws`.
8. Demonstrate use of `throw` with custom error message.
9. Create method `divide(a, b)` and `throw` if b is 0.
10. Use `throws` for a method that reads a file.

15. Create a login function that throws for empty username/password.
16. Chain a `throw` from one method to another using `throws`.
17. Demonstrate `throw new NullPointerException("custom message")`.
18. Call a method using `throws` in a try-catch in `main()`.
19. Compare behavior of throwing `RuntimeException` vs `IOException`.
20. Create a `calculateTax()` method that throws when income < 0.
21. Create a method that only throws and never catches (let main catch it).
22. Create a `FileReader` method that uses `throws FileNotFoundException`.
23. Write a method that throws `IllegalAccessException` and is called safely.
24. Demonstrate calling a `throws` method from another `throws` method.
25. Write a simple CLI tool that uses `throw` to validate inputs.

### üîπ C. Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions (Tasks 51‚Äì65)

1. List 5 checked and 5 unchecked exceptions (write code examples).
2. Write a method that throws a checked exception (`IOException`).
3. Write a method that throws an unchecked exception (`NullPointerException`).
4. Demonstrate that checked exceptions **must** be handled or declared.
5. Show that unchecked exceptions compile even without handling.
6. Try to compile a method throwing `SQLException` without `throws`.
7. Handle `IOException` when reading a non-existent file.
8. Catch `FileNotFoundException` separately and observe behavior.
