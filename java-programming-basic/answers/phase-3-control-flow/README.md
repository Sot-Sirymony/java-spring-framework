## Learning Objectives
By completing Phase 3, you will be able to:
- Write and understand conditional statements (if, if-else, switch)
- Implement different types of loops (for, while, do-while)
- Use nested control flow structures effectively
- Apply break and continue statements appropriately
- Solve complex problems using control flow logic

## How to Use This Directory
1. Start with Section A and work through each task systematically
2. Read the problem statement and attempt to solve it yourself first
3. Compare your solution with the provided answer
4. Run the code examples to see the output
5. Experiment with modifications to deepen your understanding

## Code Examples
Each section includes:
- Complete Java code solutions
- Detailed explanations of the logic
- Expected output for each program
- Tips and best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid

## Next Steps
After completing Phase 3, proceed to:
- **Phase 4**: Functions (Methods)
- **Phase 5**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
- **Phase 6**: OOP Principles
